## What?

Okami is an application development platform. It consists of several components:

- At the core is the okami engine, a tiny but flexible virtual machine.
- It is accompanied by EngineScript, a low-level scripting language intended not for application development, but for extending the capabilities of the okami engine.
   High-level languages can use EngineScript as a convenient compilation target.
- This is done by Wok, a statically typed, object-based concatenative language with automatic memory management.

## Status

2022-07-15: I have documented my new vision for the `okami` platform above.

2022-07-07: Guess what, I have picked up working on `okami` again and I am porting it to x86-64.
