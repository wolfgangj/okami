# Welcome to `wok`

## What is Wok?

The name Wok stands for "Wolfgangs Offener Kompiler" (Wolfgang's Open Compiler).

- Wok is a statically-typed, concatenative (stack-based) programming language and, obviously, a compiler for this language.
- Wok acknowledges that stack-shuffling is confusing and tries hard to reduce its impact (without giving up on concatenativity). In other words: Wok wants to make concatenative programming more accessible without watering it down.
- Wok tries to provide a simple, yet pleasantly readable syntax with visual cues.
- Wok is designed so that one can keep the full language in ones head (but provides enough convenience features to be practically useful).
- Wok generates straightforward code, i.e. no nasal-demon-defined behaviour, although at the cost of some performance.

## Status

2022-07-15: I intend to make Wok use the Okami engine as its runtime.
Therefore, I will integrate Wok into the [Okami repository](https://www.github.com/wolfgangj/okami).
